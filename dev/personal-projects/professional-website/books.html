      <h2>Effective TypeScript by Dan Vanderkam</h2>

      <p>
        I have truly enjoyed reading this book as of late. It is well paced and
        contains great detail about TypeScript and its capabilities. I feel I
        have gained a lot from reading it and I am only on Chapter 3 - Type
        Inference. I must have re-read Chapter 2 - Types, like three times and I
        was getting more from it each time.

      <h2>
        Fundamentals of Software Architecture by Mark Richards & Neal Ford
      </h2>
      <p>
        I always find myself wondering why a decision was made in software
        design. Why use one technology over another? Why use this design pattern
        over another? Why focus on this aspect of an application opposed to
        another?
      </p>
      <p>
        Fundamentals of Software Architecture has been answering a lot of those
        kinds of questions for me. It details what software architecture is, the
        responsibilities of a software architect, and goes into detail about all
        the required knowledge to understand software architecture fundamentals.
