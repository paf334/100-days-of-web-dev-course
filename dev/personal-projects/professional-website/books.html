    <h2>Effective TypeScript by Dan Vanderkam Published By O'Reilly</h2>
    <p>
      I have truly enjoyed reading this book as of late. It is well paced and
      contains great detail about TypeScript and its capabilities. I feel I have
      gained a lot from reading it and I am only on Chapter 3 - Type Inference.
      I must have re-read Chapter 2 - Types, like three times and I was getting
      more from it each time.

    <h2>Fundamentals of Software Architecture by Mark Richards and Neal Ford. Published by O'Reilly</h2>
    <p>
      I always find myself wondering why a decision was made in software design. Why use one technology over another? Why use this design pattern over another? Why focus on this aspect of an application opposed to another?
    </p>
    <p>
      Fundamentals of Software Architecture has been answering a lot of those kinds of questions for me. It details what software architecture is, the responsibilities of a software architect, and goes into detail about all the required knowledge to understand software architecture fundamentals.
