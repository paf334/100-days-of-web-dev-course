    <p>
      Hi! My name is Philip and I am a detail oriented software engineer
      passionate about learning.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have experience developing, supporting, testing, and writing
      specifications for an Enterprise Retail Software application, specifically
      in the retail furnishing space.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have worked on full stack projects in the Point of Sale, Inventory
      Management, EDI, Reporting, Trigger Architecture, and Credit Card
      Processing modules within the application.
    </p>
    <p>
      I dedicate time daily to further my knowledge about software development &
      architecture by reading books, listening to podcasts, and working on side
      projects.
    </p>
