    <section>
      <p>
        Hi! My name is Philip. I am a detail oriented software engineer
        passionate about learning.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have experience developing, supporting, testing, and writing
        specifications for an Enterprise Retail Software application,
        specifically in the retail furnishing space.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have worked on full stack projects in the Point of Sale, Inventory
        Management, EDI, Reporting, Trigger Architecture, and Credit Card
        Processing modules within the application.
      </p>
      <p>
        I dedicate time daily to further my knowledge about software development
        & architecture by reading books, listening to podcasts, and working on
        side projects.
